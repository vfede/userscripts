[Wikipedia - Show another language link in title](https://userscripts.org/users/376607/scripts)
==========
For every article in Wikipedia, these scripts show a link, near the title, to the article in the choosen language.
They also show a shortcut to the chosen language Wikipedia also from the search result page or if the article does not exists.
These scripts adapt to any Wikipedia you use and can be used simultaneously.

Example of what it looks like with a link to Italian article about Italy in the English Wikipedia using the "Wikipedia - Show Italian language link in title" script.
